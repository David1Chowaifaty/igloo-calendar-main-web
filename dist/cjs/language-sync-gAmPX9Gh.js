 * Keeps one screen's *data* in step with the selected language.

 * `t()` and the `locales` store already re-render `Lcz_*` chrome on a switch, but
 * a large part of what a screen shows is localized by the server, not by us: room
 * type and rate plan names, taxes and sources from `Get_Exposed_Property`, the
 * country list, booking payloads, applicable policies. Those were fetched with a
 * `language:` parameter at mount and stay in that language forever unless someone
 * asks again — which is what this does.
 *
 * Wire it into a screen root as three small members:
 *
 *   private languageSync = new LanguageSync(SCREEN_TABLES.channel, () => this.initializeApp());
 *
 *   componentDidLoad() { this.languageSync.connect(); }
 *   disconnectedCallback() { this.languageSync.disconnect(); }
 *
 *   @Watch('language')
 *   languageChanged(next: string, previous: string) {
 *     this.languageSync.propChanged(next, previous);
 *   }
 *
 * Both entry points funnel through `LocaleController`, so a switch costs one
 * refetch however it was triggered — the switcher calling `setLanguage`, or the
 * host PMS assigning the `language` prop, or both at once, which is what
 * `ir-locale-switcher` actually does.
