    /**
     * Builds the array of room payloads for reservation based on the user's current selections.
     *
     * For each reserved entry in `booking_store.ratePlanSelections`, this method:
     *  1) Resolves the effective `RoomType` and `RatePlan` (preferring the provided `roomTypes`
     *     argument if available, otherwise falling back to `booking_store.roomTypes`).
     *  2) Detects currency context differences between the user's currency and the property's currency.
     *  3) Locates a base variation for each reserved unit (matching adult/child/infant counts). When
     *     in a different-currency context, variations are taken from the effective rate plan instead of
     *     the selection object. If no exact variation is found, the checkout variation is used.
     *  4) Adjusts the variation with infants via `VariationService.getVariationBasedOnInfants`.
     *  5) Produces a normalized "room" object used by the booking API.

     * // Use effective availability (e.g., after currency switch) to build reservation rooms:
     * const rooms = this.filterRooms(freshAvailabilityRoomTypes);
